The File Organizer is my first Python project designed to automate file management in a specified directory. It organizes files based on their types and moves them into designated folders.

Key Features
Automatic Classification: The script sorts files by their extensions (e.g., images, documents, videos).

Pre-defined Folders: Files are moved into folders like Images, Documents, Videos, Music, and Archives.

To test the functionality, I placed multiple files of different types in the directory. This project helped me improve my Python skills and understand file handling better.
